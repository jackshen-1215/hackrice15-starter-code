# Healthcare Track

This track is dedicated to building innovative solutions that improve patient outcomes, streamline healthcare systems, and increase access to care.

## Potential Modules

*   **Telemedicine Platform:** A secure platform for virtual consultations between doctors and patients.
*   **Personalized Health Monitoring:** An application that tracks user health data (e.g., from wearables) and provides personalized insights and alerts.
*   **Appointment Scheduling System:** An intelligent system to optimize appointment booking, reduce wait times, and manage cancellations.
*   **Medical Records Management:** A secure system for storing and managing patient health records.

## Sample Module: Telemedicine Platform

This sample module provides a basic implementation for scheduling and managing telemedicine appointments.

### Module Structure

*   **Models (`models/appointment.py`):** Defines the `Appointment` SQLAlchemy model for the database.
*   **Schemas (`schemas/appointment.py`):** Contains the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
*   **CRUD (`crud/appointment.py`):** Implements the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for appointments.
*   **API Endpoints (`api/endpoints/appointments.py`):** Exposes the API routes for appointment management.
*   **Track API (`api/api.py`):** Aggregates all API routers for the healthcare track.

### Integration

The module is integrated into the main application via the main API router (`backend/api/v1/api.py`), making the endpoints available under the `/api/v1/track_specific/healthcare/` prefix.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints. Note that you will need existing user IDs for `patient_id` and `doctor_id`.

**Create a new appointment:**

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/healthcare/appointments/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "patient_id": 1,
  "doctor_id": 2,
  "appointment_time": "2024-09-15T14:30:00Z"
}'
```

**Retrieve a list of appointments:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/healthcare/appointments/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
