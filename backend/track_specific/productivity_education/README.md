# Productivity/Education Track

This track challenges you to build tools that help individuals and teams work, learn, and collaborate more effectively.

## Potential Modules

*   **AI-Powered Study Assistant:** A tool that generates summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from course materials.
*   **Smart To-Do List & Task Manager:** An application that prioritizes tasks, sets reminders, and tracks progress using smart algorithms.
*   **Collaborative Whiteboard:** A real-time collaborative space for brainstorming, project planning, and remote teaching.
*   **Focus and Habit Tracker:** A tool to help users build better habits, stay focused during work sessions, and track their progress over time.

## Sample Module: AI-Powered Study Assistant

This sample module provides a basic implementation for tracking and managing study sessions.

### Module Structure

*   **Models (`models/study_session.py`):** Defines the `StudySession` SQLAlchemy model for the database.
*   **Schemas (`schemas/study_session.py`):** Contains the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
*   **CRUD (`crud/study_session.py`):** Implements the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for study sessions.
*   **API Endpoints (`api/endpoints/study_sessions.py`):** Exposes the API routes for study session management.
*   **Track API (`api/api.py`):** Aggregates all API routers for the productivity & education track.

### Integration

The module is integrated into the main application via the main API router (`backend/api/v1/api.py`), making the endpoints available under the `/api/v1/track_specific/productivity_education/` prefix.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints. Note that you will need an existing user ID for `user_id`.

**Create a new study session:**

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/productivity_education/study_sessions/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "user_id": 1,
  "subject": "History",
  "start_time": "2024-09-15T10:00:00Z"
}'
```

**Retrieve a list of study sessions:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/productivity_education/study_sessions/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
