# Sports Track

This track is for projects that use technology and data analytics to transform the world of sports.

## Potential Modules

*   **Player Performance Analytics:** A dashboard to analyze player statistics, identify trends, and visualize performance data.
*   **Team Strategy Simulator:** A tool for coaches to model and test different game strategies and player formations.
*   **Fan Engagement Platform:** An interactive platform for fans with real-time stats, fantasy leagues, and social features.
*   **Automated Sports Journalism:** A system that uses AI to generate game summaries, player reports, and news articles from live data.

## Sample Module: Player Performance Analytics

This sample module provides a basic implementation for tracking and analyzing player performance data.

### Module Structure

*   **Models (`models/player.py`):** Defines the `Player` SQLAlchemy model for the database.
*   **Schemas (`schemas/player.py`):** Contains the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
*   **CRUD (`crud/player.py`):** Implements the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for players.
*   **API Endpoints (`api/endpoints/players.py`):** Exposes the API routes for player management.
*   **Track API (`api/api.py`):** Aggregates all API routers for the sports track.

### Integration

The module is integrated into the main application via the main API router (`backend/api/v1/api.py`), making the endpoints available under the `/api/v1/track_specific/sports/` prefix.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints.

**Create a new player:**

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/sports/players/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "LeBron James",
  "team": "Los Angeles Lakers",
  "position": "Forward",
  "points_per_game": 25.7,
  "rebounds_per_game": 7.3,
  "assists_per_game": 8.3
}'
```

**Retrieve a list of players:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/sports/players/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
