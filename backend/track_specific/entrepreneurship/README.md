## Sample Module: Market Research and Validation Tool

This sample module provides a basic implementation for conducting and storing market research.

### Module Structure

*   **Models (`models/market_research.py`):** Defines the `MarketResearch` SQLAlchemy model for the database.
*   **Schemas (`schemas/market_research.py`):** Contains the Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
*   **CRUD (`crud/market_research.py`):** Implements the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for market research.
*   **API Endpoints (`api/endpoints/market_research.py`):** Exposes the API routes for market research management.
*   **Track API (`api/api.py`):** Aggregates all API routers for the entrepreneurship track.

### Integration

The module is integrated into the main application via the main API router (`backend/api/v1/api.py`), making the endpoints available under the `/api/v1/track_specific/entrepreneurship/` prefix.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API endpoints. Note that you will need an existing user ID for `user_id`.

**Create a new market research entry:**

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/entrepreneurship/market_research/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "user_id": 1,
  "industry": "E-commerce"
}'
```

**Retrieve a list of market research entries:**

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/track_specific/entrepreneurship/market_research/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
